Recording audio using Non-blocking Pyaudio (Callback)

Pyaudio library installation could be very difficult. Will update for the steps specific for raspberry pi.

Materials:
  1. Raspberry Pi 4B+
  2. USB microphone - will need to identify the input_device_index. See Get_device_index.py
  3. Sound source
